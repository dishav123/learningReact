            <p>React is a single page application. Function name should be capital. <br/> Component vs function? <br/>
                All the components are functions but not all functions are component. Components are the function that returns UI (HTML)
                It's okay to have the naming convention of the file that returns html to .js but keeping it .jsx is a good practice.

        </div>
